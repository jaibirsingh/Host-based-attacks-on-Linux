## Uses
* FTP used to facilitate file sharing between server and client/s.
* Also used a means of transferring files to and from the directory of a web server.

## What's vulnerable
* FTP requires username and password, thus can be attacked by a brute-force attack
* In some cases, FTP servers may be configured to allow anonymous access, whic could allow anyone to the FTP server without legitimate credentials.

## PRACTICAL
* Run an nmap scan to see if an FTP service is running on the target system
* **To check if anonymous access is allowed on the FTP server**
  * `ftp [Target IP]` --> `anonymous` --> Enter --> Leave the password empty --> Enter ..... OR....
  *  `ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep ftp-*` --> This will list ftp scripts --> Run ftp-anon.nse script to see if anonymous access is granted.
 
* **Exploit with Hydra**
  * `hydra -L [path to list of usernmaes] -P [List of passwords] [target IP] -t 4 [protocol name, i.e. ftp]` --> Here -t is used to specify number of threads as running without spedcifying the numer of threads might bring the FTP server down.
  * `ftp [target IP]` --> Enter usernmae and password.
 
* **Extrazz** --> When I ran nmap scan, I noticed that the version of the fTP server was ProFTPD 1.3.5a. To see the list of exploits that can be run on every version of ProFTPD:
  * `searchsploit ProFTPD`  --> Where searchsploit is a commmand-line utility that allows to search for exploits on the Exploit DB.
