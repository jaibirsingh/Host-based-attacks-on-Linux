* A remote administration protocol that offers encryption, runs typically on port 22
* SSH authentication can be configured in two ways:
  1. Username and password authentication --> Brute-force attack possible
  2. Key based authentication --> Not feasible to attack unless I get my hands on the private key.
 

## Practical
* Use hydra as in the previous labs.
* `ssh sysadmin@[targetIP]`
* To search a file on Linux system: `find / -name "flag"
