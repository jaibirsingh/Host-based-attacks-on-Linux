* SMB = Server Message Block --> A network file sharing protocol used to facilitate the sharing of files and peripherals between computers on a LAN.
* Typically on 445 (TCP). Originally on top of NetBIOS on port 139.
* SAMBA = Linux implementation of SMB, and allows Windows to access Linux shares and devices.
* SAMBA utilizes username and password authentication --> Brute-force attack is possible
*  smbclient provides users with an ftp-like console interface.
* Once the credentials are obtained, a utility called SMBMap can be used to enumerate  --> SAMBA share drives;List the contents of the shares; Download files; Execute remote commands on the target.
* **SMBClient** -->
  * Part of the SAMBA software suite
  * Communicates with a LAN manager server
  * Offer an interface similar to that of the FTP program.
  * Used to download/upload files and retrieve directory information from the server.
 
### PRACTICAL
* Perform brute-force attack with Hydra as done in previous labs
* With the credentials revealed, use SMBMAP --> `smbmap -H [Target IP] -u [Username] -p [Password] --> This will enumrate the shares on the target --> basically users with different levels of permissions
* To access any of these shares, I can use smbclient.
* `smbmap -H [target IP] -U [username] -p [password]` --> this will also reveal shares on the target
* smbclient -L [target IP] -U [username]
* `smbclient //[target IP]/[share_name] -U [username revealed from the brute-attack]`
* `enum4linux -a [target IP]` --> If SMB is configured correctly, then the server shouldn't allow null session.
* `enum4linux -a -u [username] -p [password] [targetIP]` --> User enumeration + SID of the users
