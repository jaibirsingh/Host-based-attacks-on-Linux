* Target vulnerabilities in Linux kernel to run privileged system commands or to obtain a system shell
* Exploitation process On Linux systems differ based on:
  * The Kernel version
  * The distribution being targetted
  * The kernel exploit being used
 
* A typical methodology is as follows:
  * Identifying kernel vulnerabilities  --> Supported by automated script Linux exploit suggester
  * Downloading, compiling and transferring kernel exploits onto the target system
 
* **Linux-Exploit-Suggester**:
  * https:github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester
  * It asseses (using heuristics methods) the exposure of the given kernel on every publicly known Linux kernel exploit.
 
* Which compiler can be used to exploit code written in C? --> GCC
