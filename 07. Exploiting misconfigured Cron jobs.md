## What are Cron jobs
* Linux implements task scheduling through a utility called Cron
* Cron = time-based service --> that runs applications, scripts and other commands repeatedly on a specified schedule.
* Cron job = An application or script that has been configured to be run rpeeatedly with Cron. Eg: Daily backups to system upgrades and patches
* Crontab file = A configuration file used by the Cron utility to store and track Cron jobs that have been created.

## Exploiting misconfigure Cron jobs
* Cron jobs created by root users = Will run with root privileges

## PRACTICAL
* Figuring out whether I have any Cron jobs running, requires a lot of enumeration and search.
* `ls` --> This will reveal some folders. If we want to search for one of the folders, Go to the "/" and execute -->
* `grep -rnw /usr -e "/home/student/message"` --> This will reveal the path:line no.:first few lines of code
* To know what's path of the file: `ls -al` + `pwd`

* Step 1: Identifying the scripts that have been used by a Cron job.
* Step 2: Find if that shell script can be modified by an unprivileged user  --> That's the main flaw or vulnerability
* Step 3: Modify the script to add the current non-privileged user to sudoers file  --> Will allow to run commands that otherwise require root privileges or authentication. -->
* `printf '#! /bin/bash\necho "student ALL=NOPASSWD:ALL">> /etc/sudoers' > /usr/local/share/copy.sh`
* Adding the non-privileged user to sudoers file will allow to execute: `sudo su`. --> This will increase the privileges to the root user.
* If I am a privileged user, I can list the Cron jobs started by the user: `crontab -l`
