## What is SUID
* Generally three type of permissions are there : Read, Write and Execute (RWE) -->
* Specialized permission: SUID (Set Owner ID) permission

## What's the use
* It provides the users with the ability to execute a script or binary that requires "root" permissions.

## What could be the vulnerability
* SUID permission is just to run the scripts with elevated privilege, but not the elevated privilege itself --->
* If improperly configured, it can be exploited to an elevated session.

## Factors deciding SUID exploit
* **Owner of the SUID binary** --> We seek only to exploit SUID binaries owned by the "root" user.
* **Access permissions** --> Requires execute permission.

## What are binaries in Linux
* In Linux, binaries refer to executable files that contain compiled code, allowing them to be directly executed by the computer's processor.
* Binaries in Linux can be various types of programs or commands that perform specific tasks. They are often found in directories like /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin, and others, depending on their purpose and      permissions.
* For example, commands like ls, cp, mv, and mkdir are all binaries. When you type these commands in the terminal, the shell finds the corresponding binary in one of these directories and executes it to perform the   desired action.
* **How to figure out if a file is binary or not**
  * Using file Command:
    The file command is useful for determining the type of a file in Linux.
  * `file <filename>`
  * If the file is a text file, the output might indicate something like "ASCII text" or "UTF-8 Unicode text." If it's a binary file, it might display something like "data" or "executable."
 
## Practical
* Consider there are two files: welcome and greetings
* 'welcome' includes one of the commands where 'greetings' is executed
* We can edit 'greetings' --> 'rm greetings' -->
* Create 'greetings' so that we can open a bash using the SUID privileges of 'welcome' -->
* `cp /bin/bash greetings`
* `.\welcome` --> This will provide a shell with root privileges.
* Extrazz: `strings [filename]`  --> Display contents of the file
